PREDICTING ENERGY OUTPUT IN WIND TURBINE BASED ON WEATHER CONDITION

*INTRODUCTION:
           
           Wind speed/power has received increasing attention around the earth due to its renewable 
           nature as well as environmental friendliness. With the global installed wind power
           capacity rapidly increasing, the wind industry is growing into a large-scale business.
           Reliable short-term wind speed forecasts play a practical and crucial role in  wind energy 
           conversion systems, such as the dynamic control of wind turbines and power system scheduling.
           A precise forecast needs to overcome problems of variable energy production caused by fluctuating weather conditions. 
           Power generated by wind is highly dependent on the wind speed. Though it is highly non-linear, wind speed follows a 
           certain pattern over a certain period of time. We exploit this time series pattern to gain useful information and use it
           for power prediction.

*Project Description:

             Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a
             wind farm is highly dependent on the weather conditions present at its site. If the output can be
             predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different 
             energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction. In this paper, we predict energy 
             prediction based on weather data and analyse the important parameters as well as their correlation
             on the energy output.               
             
*Solution:

             Our aim is to map weather data to energy production. We wish to show that even data that is publicly 
             available for weather stations close to wind farms can be used to give a good prediction of the energy output.
             Furthermore, we examine the impact of different weather conditions on the energy output of wind farms.
             We are building an IBM Watson AutoAI Machine Learning technique to predict the energy output of wind turbine.
             The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be used as API in mobile app or web app building.
             We are developing a web application which is built using node red service. We make use of the scoring end point to give
             user input values to the deployed model. The model prediction is then showcased on User Interface to predict the 
             energy output of wind turbine

*Conclusion:

              We started with the aim of improving the predictions of power generated using wind energy and we have achieved
              that using LSTM as machine learning model and performing model optimization on it. We have also observed that if 
              the wind speed is less than 4 m/s the power generated by the system is zero. LSTM is not able to learn this pattern
              as this is not the part which it can understand in time series analysis. So, if a hybrid new model is created which
              can work as the combination of Decision Tree/Random Forest and LSTM we can improve upon these results as well.
